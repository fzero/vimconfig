OHAI!

This is my Vim/MacVim setup. I used several editors and IDEs in the past, but
Vim is has some pretty interesting features that you can't find anywhere else,
such as:

- Portability. Every OS I've ever heard of has some version of Vi installed,
  and generally it's Vim.

- Pretty good speed, even with tons of plugins installed (take that, Emacs).

- Let's face it: geek cred.

Yeah, it can be a little hard to get up to speed with it, but vimtutor helps a
lot. In a few minutes you'll be hjkl-ing your way through documents, deleting
lines with dd and cw-ing mistakes before the inevitable :w. Good times.

This setup includes several interesting plugins to make your life easier. Want
a list? there you go:

EasyGrep - Easy filesystem grepping goodness
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2438

NERDTree - A cool file tree explorer split
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658

SearchComplete - Tab completion on searches
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=474

Fugitive - Git plugin
http://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive

Rails - Self-explanatory
http://github.com/tpope/vim-rails

Surround - Tag surrounding goodness
http://github.com/tpope/vim-surround

(Yeah, Tim Pope rules -- you should follow him on Github.)

All of them work on plain Vim, meaning that you won't need to have MacVim (or
even a mac!) to use this setup. In fact all my MacVim specific configs are
inside an 'if' statement in vimrc, so you really don't need to worry about it.

To use this on Mac/Linux, just donwload/clone/copy it somewhere and either
rename or link the files appropriately (vim/ -> ~/.vim and vimrc -> ~/.vimrc).
This should work on Windows too, but seriously dude: why?

Have fun!
